# 100 Days of Flask – Blog App from Scratch  
**A Blind Developer’s Journey**

Welcome to my 100-day challenge of building a full-featured blog application using Flask — from absolute scratch. As a blind developer, this journey is not only about 
building a technical project but also about embracing accessibility, discipline, and growth. Each day, I document progress with clean code and purpose.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Flask blog app will include:

- User registration and authentication  
- Post creation, editing, and deletion  
- Template rendering and UI structuring  
- SQLite (or PostgreSQL) integration  
- Admin features  
- And more to come — across 100 focused days
